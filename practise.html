    <p>FogCam sprang to life in 1994 as a student project in the <a href="Department of Instructional Technologies">Department of Instructional Technologies</a> at <a href="https://www.sfsu.edu/">San Francisco State University.</a> Fogcam! is the oldest continuously operating webcam in the world.</p>
  
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam">Wikipedia confirms we are the oldest operating webcam.</a> You can even see FogCam on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995#1994">Wikipedia's list of oldest websites.</a></p>
    
    <p>We've slightly changed campus locations a few times as necessary over the years, to prevent being shut down by the university.</p>
    
    <p>Historically, the first webcam actually predated the web. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-20439301">Trojan Room coffee pot </a> cam at the University of Cambridge came online way back in 1991. It was retired in 2001.</p>
